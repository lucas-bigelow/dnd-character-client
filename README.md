### OVERVIEW

This is the client for the first capstone project for Thinkful.

The app is a Dungeons and Dragons character generator and creator.

In its full implementation, the client will satisfy the following user stories:

[] A user can visit a homepage and optionally log in.

[] A user can create a dungeons and dragons character based on the 5e edition.

[] A character in DnD can only have so many traits, races, abilities, etc. which will all be stored in the db.

[] A user can also  choose to upload a photo of their own to use as the characterâ€™s profile, or select from a small list.

[] A user can save their character to return to later, or download or print a nicely formatted character sheet to use.

[] A user can randomly generate a character.

[] This random generation can be completely random, or parameterized by the user (e.g. - make a completely random elf character).
